# ML From Scratch


## Introduction

This repository contains (what is hopefully productionized) snippets of code that are either just practice exercises, or logical extensions to the sklearn library.

A small section of this is also intended as a submission for DATA558/BIOST558 - Introduction to Machine Learning "Polished Code Release" assignment.

## Implementation Note

In all of the algorithms in this repository, unless explicitly stated otherwise, the convention for binary classification labels is -1/+1, as opposed to 0/1.

## TODO

1. Add tests and Travis CI  
2. Add code coverage  
3. Add examples  
4. Make stuff "pip install"able
